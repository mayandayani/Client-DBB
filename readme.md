<h3 align="left">Description</h3>

This project is a freelance lash artist website created using HTML, CSS, and JS. It's a responsive website designed to showcase the artist's skills, services, social media presence, and client testimonials. The site features a mobile-friendly sidebar for easy navigation and includes a convenient "book" button that links to the artist's booking system. The clean and visually appealing design ensures a user-friendly experience, allowing visitors to explore the artist's portfolio and seamlessly access essential information.

##
<h3 align="left">Intention</h3>

The vision was to create a unique and simple designed website for the business, in order to improve the branding, marketing, and customer interaction process. The original plan was to complete this project within 1 month. 

##
<h3 align="left">Reflection</h3>

There were quite a few challenges that occured along the development process such as:
- Underestimating how long the development process would take
- Lack of appreciation for how complex responsive design can be when using vanilla HTML & CSS
- Scope creep and constant revision of the end state goal
- Trying to implement large scale features without understanding how complex they can be

<h3 align="left">Optimal</h3>

If given more time, I would implement the following: 
- Implementing unique floating CSS header text that features the brand name and owner.
- A hover feature on the products cards, so that it display the product details and pricing.
- Adding a social media carousel that features the latest instagram posts
